# rockets_and_balloons
Here contains payload design, code, and analysis tools for payloads to be 
launched onboard a high-altitdue balloon or rocket. Most of these are built 
with sensors that can be obtained from https://www.adafruit.com/ . It sure
would be weak if this play ever went out of business.

Assuming I follow through, each subdirectory under the "payloads" directory
should correspond to a specific payload, and include some assembly instructions 
as well as some operating code and results code.

Then there is the "launch_logs" directory, where I detail what flew on each 
launch, and what all happened, including the data.

Finally, there is the "results" directory, which should contain some nice summarized
results of a particular science question we wanted to answer. I bet this stays blank
for some time.
